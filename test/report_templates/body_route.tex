\section{Plots}

Below is the list of all individual spectra. The dashed horizontal like determines the detection threshold for a tone to be considered detected.
Green markers are expected tones that are detected. Red markes are either tones that should be there, but are not, or tones that shouldn't be there, but are.
Black markers are tones that are not expected, but might be there due to cross-talk.
